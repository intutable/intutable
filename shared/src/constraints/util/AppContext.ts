/**
 * If the constraints were imported and executed only inside the frontend,
 * we could directly use hooks and their states instead of forwarding them â€“
 * meaning we could access the frontends scope instead of borrowing injected
 * methods and variables.
 *
 * Since the constraints are not only conditions and executements,
 * but also generate a serialized definition, we probably rely on
 * these injected states and dispatchers.
 *
 * Most of them are just the signatures of hook properties.
 * Some are methods living inside the context that validates constraints.
