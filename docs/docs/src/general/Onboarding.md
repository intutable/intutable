# Onboarding

**Dear Fellow Contributor!** You have been chosen to have the pleasure of working on this codebase. We are happy to have you on board and hope you will enjoy your time here. This document addresses juniors and will help you to get started with the project.

First of all, DO NOT expect this to be a perfect codebase. It is not. It is a work in progress and we are constantly improving it. If you find something that is not up to your standards, please feel free to improve it – your refactoring is presumably highly needed.

## Getting started

Make yourself familiar with the very basics of the stack and tools we use. You should be familiar with the tools listed below. If you are not, please take enough time to learn them. Otherwise you will have a hard time working on this project and be frustrated early on. It's crucial knowing your craftsmen tools *in extenso*. The learning curve might be steep, but it's worth it.

### General
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is extensivley used in this project. You should be familiar with advanced concepts and be able to apply them by yourself.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) - Knowing how it works and how to use it is crucial, especially how [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) operates.

### DevOps
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is not required but very useful. It simplifies your life.
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) – Our monorepo build tool. At first it is enough to know how to use it.
- [git](https://git-scm.com) – annoying, but you need to know what you are doing.
- [CI](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration) – Understand how Continuous Integration works. Closely related to [Contributing Guidelines](../misc/Contributing.md).

### Frontend specific
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) – React framework that does the heavy lifting.
- [React](https://react.dev) – The frontend framework we use.
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) – Data fetching and caching library.
- [MUI](https://mui.com) – Material UI is our UI framework.

### Backend specific
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is the database we use.
- [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org) is a helpful GUI tool for PostgreSQL.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) is our [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object–relational_mapping).
