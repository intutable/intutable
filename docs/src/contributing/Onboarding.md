# Onboarding

**Dear Fellow Contributor!**

You have been elected to work on this codebase. We are happy to have you on board and hope you will enjoy your time here. 

This document is primarily intended to help inexperienced developers to find their way around. This is not a small sandbox project and places high demands on the developer. Moreover, you must have mastered your craftsmanship in order to be able to work on it effectively.

In this respect, it gives you an initial TODO list that everyone must fulfill independently of this specific project in order to work with our stack. Depending on your experience, prior knowledge and skills, you might want to skip this document. In this case, you can go directly to the Guidelines.

## Prerequisites 🏫

Make yourself familiar with the very basics of the stack and tools we use. You should be familiar with the tools listed below. If you are not, please take enough time to learn them. Otherwise you will have a hard time working on this project and be frustrated early on. It's crucial knowing your craftsmen tools *in extenso*. The learning curve might be steep, but it's worth it. Only after you have learned your craftsmen tools, you can go on to the [next steps](#next-steps) and learn more about the software architecture and organization. 

This traffic light system indicates how important a tool or concept is and should help you to prioritize your learning:

- 🔴 – before you proceed and get your hands dirty in combat, make sure you understood it properly and in very detail!
- 🟠 – you should be familiar using it, however you can learn more advanced topics about it later on.
- 🟢 – make sure to have a basic understanding, though you can learn this while you are working on real tasks.

The following lists are not complete but will prepare you for the worst.

## Next Steps 🥳

Once you have mastered all the tools, you can proceed to learn what practices our monorepo imposes. The Guidelines will walk you through further advanced topics and required skills. It is highly necessary to follow these in order to produce consistent code later. Only then you should deal with the architecture and finally with the actual code!
