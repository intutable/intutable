# Contributing Guidelines

First of all, do NOT expect this to be a perfect codebase. It is not. It is a work in progress and we are constantly improving it. If you find something that doesn't meet your expectations, feel free to improve it.

Nevertheless, we try to apply the best code practices as often as we can. In this respect, you should internalize these and apply them on a daily basis. This will make your life easier and the life of your colleagues as well.

The next subdocuments will give you an overview of the most important guidelines and practices we use.
