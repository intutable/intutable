# Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application. Because Next.js is a framework, it already has a an architecture and we just build on top of it. The frontend is located in `/apps/frontend`.

Moreover, we use vanilla [Material UI](https://mui.com) for the UI components along vanilla [React](https://reactjs.org) for the frontend.

[SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) is used for data fetching.
