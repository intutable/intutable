# How To Use These Docs üìñ

> **Tip**: This documentation has search functionality. Look out for the üîç symbol in the top left corner.

These docs focus on the development process and easy accessibility for new developers of the application, rather than documenting the application <i>en d√©tail</i>. You will find lots of information about your everyday craftsman's tools here as well as some general architecture and design decisions.

If you are familiar with all the tools and stacks you need, you can skip the [Contributing](contributing/Contributing.md) section and head over to the [Software Architecture](software_architecture/Introduction.md) section.

## Additional Sources

In addition to this documentation, further sources are available that might be helpful:

- The source code is now hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/intutable/intutable). Though, a deprecated version can be found in the archived [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/intutable) that was used since the beginning of the project from late 2021 until the migration in late 2023.
- Each package might have one or more READMEs with more or less useful information.
- The UI has a built-in user guide `/wiki`.
- A deprecated OneNote contains outdated information and will occasionally be updated with meeting protocols etc. Ask any maintainer for access.
