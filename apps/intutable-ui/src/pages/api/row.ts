/**

`* @param {TableId | ViewId} viewId - can refer to either a table or a view.
 * Beware, however, as one column will have its own metadata entity in a table, and another
 * in every view on that table, each with different IDs.
 * So the column IDs used as keys in the {@link RowData} must match the IDs of the columns
 * in the table or view that is referenced by `viewId`. This should normally be pretty hard to
 * get wrong, but it will be quite hard to debug if you do.
 * This sounds weird, but the old set-up actually required the front-end to look into a view's
 * backend-side metadata columns and figure out the right SQL column name so it could
 * manually construct an update that would be passed directly to SQL. We also eventually want
 * to introduce n-tier views (like view -> ... -> view -> table) which are now already supported
 * by this update method.
 * @param {number | number[]} rowsToUpdate - pass in either the ID of a row to update
 * or an array of IDs to update multiple rows.
 * @return {{ rowsUpdated: number }} how many rows were updated.
 * @tutorial
 * ```

 *    viewId: {@type {TableId | ViewId}}
